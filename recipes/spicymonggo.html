    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <P>This Filipino classic vegetable dish combines the fresh flavor of Mung beans slowly simmered in Knorr Pork broth, mixed with tinapa flakes and malunggay leaves</P>
    <H3>Ingredients</H3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole monggo beans</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>7 cloves garlic, mashed</li>
        <li>3 pcs medium -sized red tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pc medium -sized onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 pcs medium -sized tinapang galunggong, fried, filleted and shredded</li>
        <li>2 pcs siling labuyo, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup malunggay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Since monggo beans are seeds, they may have acquired and collected dirt. So, you need to clean and pick them over then wash in several changes of water before draining thoroughly. Monggo beans also need to be soaked in water to soften them. For this recipe, use 4 cups of water then give it a gentle stir. Make sure to remove the floating particles on top. You don’t want any dirt on your dish.</li>
        <li>Once your beans are soft enough, get a large pot, and make it nice and warm over medium-hight heat. Then you can start sautéing the garlic, onions and tomatoes in a pot for about 2 minutes or more.</li>
        <li>You may now pour in the softened monggo beans with their own liquid before adding the Knorr Pork Cubes. You need to simmer this by turning the fire to low, cover the pot then leave it to cook for 1 hour or until the monggo beans are tender. Stir once in a while to avoid the monggo from clumping together.</li>
        <li>Once monggo beans are tender, throw in the tinapa flakes and siling labuyo. Stir gently and simmer this for about 1- 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>One more step then we are done! You just need to top the malunggay leaves on the monggo and turn off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
